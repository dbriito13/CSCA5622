    "# Nifty 50 Partial Replication \n",
    "Index funds have become a household occurence in the financial sphere, especially for retail investors, due to their simplicity, diversification and low cost compared to actively managed funds. Following an index can be done in one of two ways:\n",
    "- **Full replication:** The most common approach, where a fund holds all constituent stocks present in the index, with the same weights as the index.\n",
    "- **Partial Replication:** With this approach, only a subset of the index's constituents is selected, which should aim to approximate the overall index performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Partial replication can offer a number of benefits over full replication, but mainly:\n",
    "- Lower transaction costs: Reducing the number of stocks traded minimizes fees such as brokerage fees.\n",
    "- Reduced Trading fees: By potentially avoiding low-liquidity stocks, we avoid have wider bid-ask spreads, as well as having less market impact.\n",
    "- Higher flexibility: Funds can add other constraints on top of avoiding low-liquidity stocks, such as those on sectors or specific stocks, giving them better control over their risk management.\n",
    "Our project's goal is to apply supervised learning techniques to develop a partial replication strategy, minimizing the tracking error of our portfolio."

    "## Methodology\n",
    "The project will focus on the NIFTY 100 index, which includes the top 100 companies in the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) based on market capitalization. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin by gathering the minute-level data for both the index as well as the constituents data. Combining the data into a single dataframe, and perform some basic cleaning tasks, removing certain columns with a large number of empty values, as well as rows without target value, etc. Our target variable will be the **NIFTY 100 index price**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our goal is to reduce the number of constituents to use only a subset of the total 100 stocks, our models will follow a 2 step approach:\n",
    "1. Feature Selection: We will first apply different feature selection techniques, (Lasso regression, Correlation matrix, Mutual information) to identify the most relevant stocks for our model.\n",
    "2. Model Training: Once the most relevant features (stocks) are selected, we will train different supervised learning models on the reduced dataset, these models will predict the weights for each of the relevant stocks.\n",
    "To ensure the robustness of the test results, while accounting for the nature of the data (ordered time series) we will use a **sliding window approach**, where:\n",
    "* A fixed-size window (roughly 1-year) is used to train the model.\n",
    "* The model will be tested on roughly the next 3 months.\n",
    "* The window will slide forward, repeating until we use all available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a certain model, the overall out-of-sample error will be the average error over all the windows. The error we will aim to minimize is the **tracking error**, for simplicity models will minimize MSE. Finally, we will compare models by plotting the error vs the number of stocks, to visualize how it evolves as we reduce the size of the subset of constituents chosen.\n",

    "Tracking error is the metric most commonly used to judge how well a replicating portfolio tracks the benchmark index, for full replication we would expect this to be close to 0 (slightly higher than 0 due to transaction costs or rebalancing delays).\n",
    "\n",
    "The tracking error is defined as the standard deviation of the differences between the index and replicating portfolio over a specified time period. Central to this metric is the time period that the difference in returns is calculated over, usually this is done daily, weekly or monthly.\n",
    "\n",

    "*  $R_{index}(t)$ is the index's return at time $t$,  \n",
    "*  $T$  is the total number of time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "We base ourselves on this metric, and add a small adjustment, where from the first return of the portfolio, the trading cost is subtracted, this is a simulated trading cost, which we will simply set to 0.2%.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next sections we will see that our data comes in minute intervals, so, to obtain the tracking error for daily returns, we will first aggregate the returns per day, and then utilize the formula above. To aggregate returns we do:\n",

    "Firstly, let's explain the general architecture of the model, firstly, we must understand the pitfalls of using time series data, and how it affects our choice of cross validation strategy. Since the order of data must be preserved, we cannot use a conventional cross validation, and rather opt for a TimeSeriesSplit, specifically, we set the training and test sizes of the window, to get the desired sliding window result, where the training window is roughly 1 year, and the testing widnow around 3 months, this yields a total of 18 windows.\n",

    "For each fold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Perform feature selection (ex: Lasso with high alpha, Dropping Correlated variables, Mutual Information) using the threshold.\n",
    "2. Train model on reduced feature space, with hyperparameter tuning to choose best parameters.\n",
    "3. Save the tracking error and number of features (stocks) used in training\n",

    "Finally, we return the following averages over the folds\n",

    "* Average tracking error.\n",
