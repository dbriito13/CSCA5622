    "# Nifty 50 Partial Replication \n",
    "Index funds have become a household occurence in the financial sphere, especially for retail investors, due to their simplicity, diversification and low cost compared to actively managed funds. Following an index can be done in one of two ways:\n",
    "- **Full replication:** The most common approach, where a fund holds all constituent stocks present in the index, with the same weights as the index.\n",
    "- **Partial Replication:** With this approach, only a subset of the index's constituents is selected, which should aim to approximate the overall index performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Partial replication can offer a number of benefits over full replication, but mainly:\n",
    "- Lower transaction costs: Reducing the number of stocks traded minimizes fees such as brokerage fees.\n",
    "- Reduced Trading fees: By potentially avoiding low-liquidity stocks, we avoid have wider bid-ask spreads, as well as having less market impact.\n",
    "- Higher flexibility: Funds can add other constraints on top of avoiding low-liquidity stocks, such as those on sectors or specific stocks, giving them better control over their risk management.\n",
    "Our project's goal is to apply supervised learning techniques to develop a partial replication strategy, minimizing the tracking error of our portfolio."

    "## Methodology\n",
    "The project will focus on the NIFTY 100 index, which includes the top 100 companies in the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) based on market capitalization. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin by gathering the minute-level data for both the index as well as the constituents data. Combining the data into a single dataframe, and perform some basic cleaning tasks, removing certain columns with a large number of empty values, as well as rows without target value, etc. Our target variable will be the **NIFTY 100 index price**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our goal is to reduce the number of constituents to use only a subset of the total 100 stocks, our models will follow a 2 step approach:\n",
    "1. Feature Selection: We will first apply different feature selection techniques, (Lasso regression, Correlation matrix, Mutual information) to identify the most relevant stocks for our model.\n",
    "2. Model Training: Once the most relevant features (stocks) are selected, we will train different supervised learning models on the reduced dataset, these models will predict the weights for each of the relevant stocks.\n",
    "To ensure the robustness of the test results, while accounting for the nature of the data (ordered time series) we will use a **sliding window approach**, where:\n",
    "* A fixed-size window (roughly 1-year) is used to train the model.\n",
    "* The model will be tested on roughly the next 3 months.\n",
    "* The window will slide forward, repeating until we use all available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a certain model, the overall out-of-sample error will be the average error over all the windows. The error we will aim to minimize is the **tracking error**, for simplicity models will minimize MSE. Finally, we will compare models by plotting the error vs the number of stocks, to visualize how it evolves as we reduce the size of the subset of constituents chosen.\n",

    "Tracking error is the metric most commonly used to judge how well a replicating portfolio tracks the benchmark index, for full replication we would expect this to be close to 0 (slightly higher than 0 due to transaction costs or rebalancing delays).\n",
    "\n",

    "*  $T$  is the total number of time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "We base ourselves on this metric, and add a small adjustment, where from the first return of the portfolio, the trading cost is subtracted, this is a simulated trading cost, which we will simply set to 0.2%.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next sections we will see that our data comes in minute intervals, so, to obtain the tracking error for daily returns, we will first aggregate the returns per day, and then utilize the formula above. To aggregate returns we do:\n",

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "We can observe that all models follow a similar trend, where the tracking error is lower the higher the number of stocks we can invest in, but we can still see that our models obtain decent results with a very low number of stocks (under 20) which range between 0.2 and 0.3%. The best results are seen from the Lasso - ElasticNet experiment, while the rest of the applied methods exhibit varying results but slightly worse than this one. This could be due to the way that Lasso performs feature selection. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since Lasso drops features based on their impact towards the target variable (NIFTY 100 Index Price) it might be better at removing features that are less useful in influencing the index price, while other feature selection methods, such as correlation, mutual information or autoencoders, don't include the output in their decision to assign weights or scored to features."

    "Future Work\n",
    "For future work, we could explore other autoencoder architectures to enhance our feature selection process. Some examples of autoencoder architectures that might be considered include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Variational Autoencoders (VAE)**: These are designed to learn a probabilistic representation of the input data, which can be useful for generating new data points similar to the original data.\n",
    "* **Denoising Autoencoders (DAE)**: These are trained to reconstruct the input data from a corrupted version, helping in learning robust feature representations.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Additionally, we could explore other feature selection algorithms, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**: This method recursively removes the least important features and builds the model on the remaining features. It uses the model’s accuracy to identify the optimal number of features.\n",
    "* **Tree-based Feature Selection**: Algorithms like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Trees can provide feature importances, which can be used to select features that contribute significantly to the target variable.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Exploring these additional methods and architectures could lead to improved feature selection, thereby enhancing the performance of our models in the partial replication of stock indices."
